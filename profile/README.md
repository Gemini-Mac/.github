## What is Gemini?  

![Gemini App Interface](https://felloai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gemini-macOS-Desktop-Client-%E2%80%93-AI-Chatbot-app-Fello-AI-for-Your-Mac.jpg)  

Gemini is a specialized application built for macOS to detect and remove duplicate files across your system. Instead of manually searching through folders for duplicate photos, videos, or documents, Gemini automates the process with high accuracy, freeing up valuable disk space.  

Created by MacPaw, the same team behind CleanMyMac, Gemini combines speed with smart algorithms. It not only identifies exact duplicates but also highlights similar files, such as multiple versions of the same photo, giving you the choice to keep the best copy.  

The app integrates seamlessly into macOS, with a clean interface that makes the process intuitive. It includes drag-and-drop scanning, auto-selection for safe cleaning, and the ability to restore files from the Trash if needed.  

Gemini is particularly valuable for users with large photo libraries, design assets, or music collections where duplicates tend to accumulate unnoticed. By cleaning out redundant files, your Mac runs smoother and you gain back significant storage space.  

With support for the latest Apple Silicon Macs and compatibility across multiple macOS versions, Gemini is a reliable tool for keeping your system organized and optimized.
